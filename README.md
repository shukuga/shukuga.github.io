This is a personal project to mod the game Arcanum/Theory of magic (aka wizrobe) by lerpinglemur. The original can be found at http://lerpinglemur.com/arcanum/ or https://www.kongregate.com/games/lerpinglemur/theory-of-magic
I do not wish to deny lerpinglemur any credit or income from their game.

My goal is to make a space-survival themed game using the Arcanum mechanics. I've taken build #944 and modified the wizrobe.dist.bundle.js to find the .json and .js files in the same directory because I don't know how to make directories in github. The core .js file was also modified to reduce the base skill progress cost to 10 from 50 and increase the base skill advancement from 0.5/s to 1.0/s. The default max skill level is decreased to 2 from 5. The default name was changed from Wizrobe to Unnamed Survivor. Tier checking was removed. The script for Kongregate was also removed. All other changes have been to the .json files. They still contain wizrobe content because there are errors if some of the entries are missing eg gold or prologue event.
